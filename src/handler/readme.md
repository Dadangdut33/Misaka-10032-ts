# Handler for the bot

- Command for the bot commands
- BotEvent for events listener for the bot
- Feature to handle the bot features -> currently not used by anything but still in the code
- Toggleable to toggle the bot features -> currently not used by anything but still in the code

I took the handler originally from an open source repository with little knowledge before.
And yea it was a bit of a mess. I have only recently started to refactoring and cleaning it.
