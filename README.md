## Some info

The bot is currently still in proggress of rewrite in typescript and still using discord.js v12. After rewrite in typescript is done, i will try to use discord.js v13.

## Getting Started

First clone the repo and install all the packages by doing `npm install` Then run the bot by doing `npm start`. \
Alternatively, you can build/compile the bot to js by doing `npm run build`. You can also start the builded version by doing `npm run start-build`. Or you can build and run the file directly by running `npm run build-run`. \
**More info later.**
